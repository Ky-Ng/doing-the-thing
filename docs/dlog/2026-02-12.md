Super interesting! I didn't fully intuit the $f^\top L f = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} (f_i - f_j)^2$ but understood that the Rayleigh Quotient for a matrix $M$ returns the eigenvalue when given the eigenvector as input.

$$R(v ; M) = \lambda$$ 

where $v$ is an eigenvector of $M$ and $\lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalue.

Next step tomorrow is to fully gain intuition on the meaning of the Rayleigh Quotient applied to the Laplacian matrix.
