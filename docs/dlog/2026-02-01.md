??? note "Some Reflection"
    - Balancing classes and doing AI research is a little bit difficult but figuring out a good rhythm! (I honestly love all my classes so I think it's time for me to find a way to prioritize things; especially the classes I'm taking pass no pass haha!)

    - As a personal note, I will have to get over my silly infatuation with getting a 4.0 when graduating this semester. Honestly, talking to two of my really good friends, this past Friday reminded me of the joys of senior year--yes to work hard and continue building your skills but also to enjoy being an `LA tourist` for a bit. I will try my best to let go of the proxy that is grades, and remember why I do what I do--it's definitely not for some 8-bit ASCII character on a slow loading USC academics page at the end of May.

    - I've been waking up quite early (5am-7am) but I think I'm going to promise to myself this semester no all nighters; sure 5am wakeup is ok but not some pseudo sleep at 3am on the tables of Leavey Library (I'm sure it's not that deep)

    - All right, now that Claude Code is finished with the next coding practice, it's time for me to get back to work
  
1. Finished reviewing `practice1` environment and finished `practice2`
2. `practice3`
3. MATS CodeSignal
