## Reproducibility
In the original implementation of the paper from earlier this year, performance was at a ceiling (close to 98% accuracy). However, reproducing the model led to different training accuracies across runs. After verifying that the input data and order is consistent, the `torch.seed()` was the root cause of hte issue between different runs.
