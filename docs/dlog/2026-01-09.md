Learning about circuits was one of the coolest things in the MechInterp section of ARBOx. This is the most clear evidence to me that models are implementing very non-trivial algorithms and are not just "stochastic parrots".

Left 1 hour early in the day to go to the LISA ARENA x ARBOx social.

Key concepts that I will need to revisit:

1. Logit, Head, Layer Attribution, Logit Diffs

2. Activation Patching

3. Path Patching
