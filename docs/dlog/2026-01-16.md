Lesson learned: Do rigorous literature review! We found that the paper [Refusal Direction is Universal Across Safety-Aligned Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17306); however, things even seem more complicated! See [LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878v1).

We also presented the [results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jQDJhF4orOrSzpVKMJwtU52u-vlzT77pCK8gZGwO9g/edit?usp=sharing) during the ARBOx final presentations! Will work on the writeup sometime next week!
