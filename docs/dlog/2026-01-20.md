## Plan for Today

1. Read `A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits`

2. Read `Automated Circuit Interpretation via Probe Prompting` https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zQqGhKPqaCBZZDCge/automated-circuit-interpretation-via-probe-prompting

2.5. IOI either implement (Neel Nanda has a video)/ARENA and read the paper

3. Read more Anthropic Circuit related papers

4. Read Circuit Tracing Automation related papers

5. Develop a tractable plan for a minimal project and writeup by the EOW (Friday, January 23rd)

  - Thinking now I have about 18 hours over the next 3 days so perhaps I can do a Neel Nanda style MATS application project on this!

## Meetings

1. Prep for meeting with Evan Feder

2. Prep for meeting with J Rosser

3. Prep to learn about Singular Learning Theory from Ilya Shirokov


## Checklist Concepts to know by EOD
- [ ] Negative writes (either through MLP or MHA)?
