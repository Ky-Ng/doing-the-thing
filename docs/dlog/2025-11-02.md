## Reflection
- Happy Spring Forward! Today I did not spend as much time on Interpretability math but instead focused more on reflecting on where I have been and where I want to be. Working backwards from the goal of doing interpretability research in 2026!

Aside: 3B1B has a pretty great video introducing Word Embeddings! Might be useful for the AI Safety group!
