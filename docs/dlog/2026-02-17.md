Actionable Items:

- [x] `get_rayleigh_quotient(vec: Float[Tensor, "n"], laplacian: Float[Tensor, "n n"]) -> Float[Tensor, ""]`; function which 

- [x] Plot eigenvectors in addition to eigenvalues

- [ ] Create the parent class `Graph` and three child classes `PathGraph`, `StarGraph`, `DyckGraph`; each support creating a specific type of graph and the `get_adjacency_matrix` function

- [x] Visually compare each of the classes of graphs

- [x] Use Claude to create a UI which allows you to easily:
  (a) Create a type of graph (e.g. `PathGraph`) and save the graph to a .txt for uploading
  (b) Visualize the graph topology
  (c) See the eigenvalue spectrum
  (d) select an eigenvector to plot and its values get imposed onto the graph topology on (b) with edges annotated with difference betwen nodes
  (e) unselect and view just topology

I'm heavily included to use an AI coding assitant (Claude Code) only for the last portion to make sure my logic is correct
