## AI Safety
- Kicked off the meeting going over the abstract of [Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566)

## Neural Networks from Scratch
- During the second meeting (See first meeting: [2025-10-30](./2025-10-30.md)) of Neural Networks from Scratch (a new chapter of Recursion Reading Group (RRG) discussions), I met up with my co-lead to motivate ML from first principles before diving into the fancy math and libraries
- Specifically, we derived the intuition for multiplication as a similarity metric and addition as a way to aggregate similarity over pattern matching of an $x$ and $w$ vector.
  - Since the cohort consists of Computational Linguistics, CS, and Cognitive Science majors, we used C++ to program a dot product calculator (on paper, note that USC's intro CS classes are in C++) and mapped the Dot Product to the first layer of a Neural Network
  - Hopefully, by making this event unplugged and based on intuitions first, it provides the cohort mates a chance to talk and converse about AI Safety in addition to making sure no one is left behind
