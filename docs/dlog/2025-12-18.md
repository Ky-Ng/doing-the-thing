## Goals
1. Follow Neel Nanda's guide on how to work on an interpretability project
  - Note: I think my focus on linguistics may be very different from what Neel's MATS stream is about; nevertheless I think it will be a good opportunity to start working on a novel research idea in a constrained time-box

## Progress
1. 1 hour brainstorming session with GPT on roadmap for executing the experiment
  - Started looking into the interpretability technique (linear probe) contenders and models (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek)
  - A new TODO is to understand how Reasoning models work mathematically (high level intuition)
