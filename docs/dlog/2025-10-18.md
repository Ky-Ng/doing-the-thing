## Learning
1. Work on understanding how Gaussian Distributions and Z-scores work
2. Review of how to take an integral, applied to finding the probability density between two points
3. Look into [Shannon 194](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pd) Information Theory *PART I: DISCRETE NOISELESS SYSTEMS*

## Application
Applied to ARENA 7.0. The application was really fun since I learned about sandbagging and scheming. Since I am new to these concepts I wish I had more time to work on reading the papers/responding to the questions but most importantly, I *did the thing*!
