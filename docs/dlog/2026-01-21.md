## Meetings

1. Met with J Rosser (one of the nicest people I've met)

2. Clement Dumas currently doing MATS (super patient at explaining and very insightful)

## Progress

- A little bit slower progress on ACDC then I would have liked. I started unit testing KL Divergence and understanding the ACDC algorithm better (something I got tripped up on was that the activation patching is the "removal of the edge" not actually ablating (`zeroing`)) it

- Finished watching up to the paper review from Neel Nanda and Arthur Conmy ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn4GqR0DCx8) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJyqmJW2wM))
