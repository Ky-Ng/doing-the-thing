# Doing The Thing: From Mechanical Turk to Mech Interp

<sub> For motivation/momentum purposes, current consecutive streak: {{ dlog_consecutive_days() }} days! </sub>

## What is this?
Here it goes! I'm Kyle, a 4th year Computational Linguistics student at USC. This is the start of my AI Safety journey!

I learned about AI Safety from the Seattle Llama4 Hackathon on June 21st, 2025 where I learned of [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com). After finishing an awesome summer of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Labs), I realized the problems which excite me the most lie at the crossroads of engineering and science (computation and linguistics). 

The urgent need for understanding increasingly capable AI models coupled with a burning passion for working at the interdisciplinary intersection of NLP, linguistics, and engineering at scale has **sharpened my goal: to become an AI Safety researcher in Mechanistic Interpretability**.

## Working Backwards :octicons-clock-16:
Sometimes (often) I get analysis paralysis or want to wait for the perfect {time, situation, background, preparation} to start which makes it difficult to get into pursuing my goals (and dreams). So this time around, I know my goal **to become an AI Safety/Mech Interp** researcher! After finding David Quarel's [do the thing](https://davidquarel.github.io/2024/02/04/Do-the-thing.html#fn:audience) I decided that this site is a place where I will keep myself acountable for *doing the thing*.

- Doing --> Working through math problems, reading papers, writing down lists of possible intersections of linguistics and NLP
- The Thing --> Any of the above for at least 1 hour every day, with consistent (though not perfect) progress.

## What is **dlog**? 
I am starting this daily log or *dlog* where every day I will document my progress. I hope that the daily act of documenting will make me more resilient and help prove to myself how badly I want to be an interpetability researcher. With the help of AI, a macro pulls the daily logs into the summary you see below:

??? example "Extra Stuff (click me)" 

    ### Wait What's Computational Linguistics?

    As a Computational Linguistics student, I see Computational Linguistics as three parts:

    1. Linguistics = study of *human* language processing / cognition
    2. Mechanistic Interpretability = study of *LLM* language processing / cognition
    3. Computational Linguistics = Interdisciplinary approach to studying LLM language processing 

    The Computational Linguistics topics that pull me at 9.8 m / s^2 are concepts like Information Theory and Probabilistic Phonology in addition to Theoretical Machine Learning and NLP.

    ### What does AI Safety and Mechanistic Interpretability mean to me?
    - I hope that having deep knowledge in both the fields of linguistics and ML/NLP can help me build a more holistic understanding of LLM cognition and language processing. 
    - I see Mechanistic Interpretability as a sort of [psycholinguistics](https://www.britannica.com/science/psycholinguistics) (the study of real-time processing of language) for LLMs. 
    - Furthermore, I see Mechanistic Interpretability as a foundational basis for understanding AI systems. Perhaps understanding models (such as like biological organisms) can support the other branches of AI Safety (alignment, control, governance, and more).
